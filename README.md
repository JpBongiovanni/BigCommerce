I apologize, I was not able to complete the assignment. I was able to utilze the bigcommerce GUI to add my product and create my special items category, and I believe I have the correct function to change the image when I hover over the image. However, due to being unfamiliar with Stencil, I was unable to find out where to place the code, or connect it to the proper tags.

I added the js hover function to the bottom of the app.js file, and I believe that I needed to make changes to the amp-image tag in the product-view.html file.

Thank you for your consideration.
